# Face-Fractals
This repo currently contains pre-computed NSR and NMSID values for sierpinski carpet upto 6 iterations.

## Usage
1. Go to the Google [`Colab notebook`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1haXgQ2K-c1hGtKapm4KVJHrzArlEsnlB?usp=sharing).

1. Follow the steps given in the notebook.

2. Upload the corresponding NSR and NMSID files for a particular iteration.

3. Run the code cells.

## TODO
1. Edit the notebook such that an image can be taken as input directly.

1. C++ is used to compute the NMSID as it is faster in that language, could also use numpy in python to generate the NMSID values, now that I think of it.

1. Re-evaluate the fractal dimension for 6th-iteration carpet values.
