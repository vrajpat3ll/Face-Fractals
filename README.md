# Face-Fractals
This repo currently contains pre-computed NSR and NMSID values for sierpinski carpet upto 6 iterations.
<br>
C++ is used to compute the NMSID as it is faster in that language.
<br>
Could also use numpy now that I think of it.
<br>
Disclaimer: 5 iterations' values might be wrong due to some error.

## Usage

1. Go to the google colab notebook.
2. Upload the corresponding NSR and NMSID files for a particular iteration.
3. Run the code cells.
